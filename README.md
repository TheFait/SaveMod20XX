# SaveMod20XX
The Save Modifier for the 20XX Roguelike Platformer - Requires .NET 4.5.2

Welcome to SaveMod20XX!

This application is able to modify the key portions of the 20XX save file to enable/disable items of your choosing to customize your game experience.

To use:
* Make sure you have .NET 4.5.2 installed and enabled on your system
* Either download the executable from /SaveMod20XX/bin/Release/ or compile the source code yourself
* Run the program once with no arguments to generate a default XML settings file
* Configure the elements you wish to enable/disable in the settings file using a text editor (preferably one with XML code coloring support, such as the fabulous Notepad++ located at https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
* Drag-and-drop your 20XX save file onto the executable (or provide it's full filepath as the singular argument to the program)
* In the future, when item flags and locations within the file change, simply adjust the values within the settings file to continue to use the program.
